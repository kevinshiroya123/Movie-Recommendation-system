# Movie-Recommendation-system
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using a content-based approach enhanced with the FAISS library for scalable nearest neighbor search. The system uses the TMDB dataset and recommends movies based on genres, popularity, vote count, and storyline similarity.

Overview:

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that ranks movies based on:

Genres: Prioritized for stronger recommendations.
Popularity: Ensures relevance.
Storyline Similarity: Matches similar plots and keywords.
Vote Count: Considers movies with significant user engagement.
The system is built using Python, leverages FAISS for scalable similarity search, and processes over 900,000 movie records from the TMDB dataset.


Features
Dynamic Genre Matching: Combines genres of movies matching the query title for personalized recommendations.
Popularity Threshold: Focuses on highly popular movies (e.g., top 20% by popularity).
Efficient Search with FAISS: Handles large datasets efficiently, offering real-time recommendations.
Weighted Recommendation:
Higher weights for genres and popularity.
Balanced consideration for vote count and storyline.
